# Conclusion

Wow! Well done for getting this far. You will now see the completed web application in the first tab, and the code editor in another. 

Over the course of this tutorial, you have seen:

- Connecting to InterSystems IRIS using the DB-API for SQL commands and queries.
- Using SQLAlchemy to return results directly as a Pandas dataframe.
- Creating an IRIS Native connection to access classes, objects and server-side methods.
- The basics of creating a Streamlit Web Application with Python.

That's a lot! Luckily you are free explore the code and the project in your own time in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gabriel-ing/python_coffeeco). You can even fork the repo and create your own version!

Whether this is your first time exploring InterSystems IRIS, or you are a seasoned ObjectScript professional branching out to applications, we would welcome your contributions on the [Developer Community](https://community.intersystems.com) - it's a great place to learn, discuss and ask questions about all things InterSystems.
